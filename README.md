# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic, browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game created with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project is a simple implementation of the game, allowing two players to compete on the same screen.

## Features

- **Interactive 3x3 Grid:** A clean and responsive game board.
- **Two-Player Gameplay:** Players alternate turns, placing 'O's and 'X's.
- **Win and Draw Detection:** The game automatically detects winning combinations and draw conditions.
- **Game Over Screen:** A message appears to announce the winner or a draw.
- **Reset and New Game:**
  - A **"Reset Game"** button to clear the board at any time.
  - A **"New Game"** button appears after a game ends to allow for a quick rematch.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the game.
- **CSS3:** For styling the game board, buttons, and overall layout.
- **JavaScript (ES6):** For the game logic, including handling player turns, checking for win/draw states, and managing UI updates.

## How to Play

1.  Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2.  The game will start with Player O's turn.
3.  Click on an empty square to place your mark.
4.  The turn will automatically switch to the next player.
5.  The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
6.  If all squares are filled and no one has won, the game is a draw.
7.  Click the **"New Game"** button to play again, or the **"Reset Game"** button to clear the board mid-game.
